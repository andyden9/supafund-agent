Hi OLAS Team,

I'm working on integrating a Supafund Agent using the Trader Quickstart, and I wanted to share some technical challenges I've encountered that are taking longer than expected to resolve.

## TL;DR
After 22+ hours of debugging, I've made significant progress but need a weekend extension (2-3 days) to properly complete and test the integration.

## Technical Issues Encountered

1. **Python Environment** (~2h)
   - Python 3.12 incompatibility (requires <3.12)
   - PYENV_VERSION env var conflicts
   - packaging version conflicts with open-aea

2. **Blockchain Transaction Timeouts** (~4h)
   - Default 60s timeout insufficient for Gnosis chain
   - RPC node performance issues
   - Had to modify autonomy/chain/tx.py to increase timeout 10x

3. **Docker Configuration** (~3h)
   - Missing Docker image tags
   - Missing /data/ and /benchmarks/ volume mounts in templates
   - Had to patch autonomy/deploy/generators/docker_compose/templates.py

4. **RPC Configuration Split** (~6h) ⭐ Most Complex
   - System has TWO separate RPC config mechanisms:
     a) Ledger Connection (needs RPC_0 env var)
     b) Funds Manager Skill (has its own RPC config)
   
   - config.json RPC is only mapped to SKILL_FUNDS_MANAGER
   - NOT mapped to RPC_0 → ledger connection uses default localhost:8545
   - Result: 139+ connection refused errors, agent stuck in check_stop_trading_round
   
   - This appears to be a deployment generator gap/bug
   - Workaround: manually add "RPC_0=..." to agent_0.env

5. **OPENING_MARGIN Semantics** (~3h)
   - Counter-intuitive: larger OPENING_MARGIN filters OUT more markets
   - Query: openingTimestamp_gt: (current_time + OPENING_MARGIN)
   - Means: find markets that close AT LEAST OPENING_MARGIN in the future
   - Setting it to 6.5 days filtered out all markets closing in 4.3 days

6. **Language Filtering** (~2h)
   - Default: ["en_US"]
   - Supafund markets: "en"
   - Mismatch → all markets filtered

7. **Fund Management** (~2h)
   - Deleting .operate/services creates new Service Safe each time
   - Lost ~20 xDAI locked in abandoned Safes
   - Documentation doesn't clearly warn against this

**Total debugging time: 22+ hours**

## Progress Made

✅ Service successfully deployed
✅ Markets successfully retrieved
✅ Created comprehensive fixes and documentation:
   - Modified timeout configs
   - Patched Docker templates
   - Created helper scripts
   - Wrote 5 detailed troubleshooting documents

⚠️ Currently fixing: RPC_0 configuration for ledger connection

## Remaining Work (~20 hours)

- Fix RPC config: 2h
- Implement Supafund analysis logic: 8h
- Testing and optimization: 4h
- Pearl integration testing: 4h
- Documentation: 2h

## Request

Could we extend the deadline to Monday (additional 2-3 days)?

This would allow us to:
- Properly test all functionality
- Ensure code quality
- Provide complete documentation
- Deliver a stable, reliable product

## Feedback for OLAS Team

The Autonomy framework is powerful, but for quickstart/prototyping, it may be overly complex. Some suggestions:

1. **Documentation**: Add troubleshooting guide for common issues (RPC config, volume mounts, OPENING_MARGIN semantics)

2. **Config Generator**: Auto-map config.json RPC to RPC_0 env var

3. **Docker Templates**: Include /data/ and /benchmarks/ mounts by default

4. **Simple Template**: Consider a "simple agent" template for Pearl integration that doesn't require the full Autonomy stack

We're committed to completing this and contributing back our fixes and documentation. We just need reasonable time to ensure quality over rushing a buggy product.

Thank you for your understanding!

Best regards,
Andy
